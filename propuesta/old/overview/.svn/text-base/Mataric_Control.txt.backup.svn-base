5. Conclusions and the Future of Multi-Robot Systems

Behavior-based (BB) control has been a popular paradigm of choice in the control of multi-robot systems (MRS). The BB control methodology represents a robust and effective way to control individual as well as multiple robots. BB control provides a tight coupling between sensing and action and does not rely on the acquisition of such world models. As such it is a very effective control methodology in the dynamic and unstructured environments in which MRS inherently operate.

A General Algorithm for Robot Formations Using Local Sensing and Minimal Communication
Jakob Fredslund, Maja J Mataric

In this work we have studied the problem of achieving global, coordinated behavior in a group of distributed robots using only local sensing and minimal communication. As an instance of this general problem, we have considered formations. We study how to achieve global-level formation coordination without providing the robots with global knowledge of other robots' positions or headings.

II. Related Work 
AVARIETY of approaches have been proposed to create global behavior in a group of mobile robots. [11]  showed how a set of simple behaviors (avoidance, aggregation, and dispersion), based on local sensing only, can be combined so that a global  flocking behavior emerges, and demonstrated the behaviors on a group of 13 mobile robots.

[16] demonstrated a robot soccer-playing team with a minimalist, behavior-based control system. By combining a few basic behaviors, two different group formations of three robots emerged. In [9], as few as two basic, local behaviors (avoidance and goal seeking) were shown in experiments with five physical robots to be enough to result in a successful collaborative box-pushing behavior. [17] presented work where a group of real robots, with only touch sensors, were able to form a physical chain reaching from a nest to a source of food, and use it to collect and transport food. [2] presented theoretical work where a large set of robots, represented as points in the plane, congregated at a single position. Moving synchronously in discrete time steps, robots iteratively observed neighbors within some visibility range V , and followed simple rules to update their position. In contrast to all these demonstrations, formations require a more precise  and reliable spatial structure. 

In [14], a group of simulated robots formed approximations to circles and simple polygons, using global knowledge of all robots' positions. Each robot oriented itself to, e.g., the furthest and nearest robot. In [5], a similar setup was presented, but group motion was also considered, e.g., a matrix formation performing a right turn. In [10], a formation is defined by a so-called virtual  structure (VS). The algorithm assumed that all robots had global knowledge; it iteratively fit the VS to the current robot positions, displaced the VS in some desired direction, and updated the robots' positions.

In [3], three principles of formation control are identified: unit-center-referenced, leader-referenced, and neighbor- referenced. In the first, each robot decides its position relative to the centroid of all robots; in the second, the robot uses the position of a predetermined leader; and in the third, the robot's nearest neighbor is used as a reference point. The work was demonstrated in experiments using physical robots with odometry, GPS, and global broadcast of the robots' coordinates. In [7], each robot was controlled using local information, either by referencing itself to one neighboring robot and maintaining a certain distance and angle to it (l - phi   control), or to two neighbors and maintaining two fixed distances to those (l - l control). The algorithm was demonstrated in simulation. The l - phi  control was adopted in [1] as part of the Leader-Following behavior. In an experiment with two physical robots, the follower (using a color camera and color-blob tracking) kept a fixed heading and distance to the leader. In [4], simulated robots had a set of attachment sites defined uniformly around the body, allowing the group to \snap" into shape as robots were `pulled' toward each other's sites. However, multiple configurations with the same attachment sites were possible. In [13], simulated robots were represented as points in the plane; spatial patters emerged from using local force laws between neighbors. The multiple-configuration problem (as in [4]) was solved by adding special labels to the particles that others could detect.

There is thus a spectrum of strategies, ranging from simple, behavior-based, purely local ones out of which global formations emerge, to more involved ones relying, to varying extent, on global knowledge, typically a global coordinate system and/or knowledge of other robots' positions and headings. The former category is characterized by minimalism and robustness but a lack of guarantees that the desired formation will actually emerge; the latter category is characterized by reliability and effciency but also a need for global knowledge and computation. [11], [16], [9], [17], [14], [4] all share the feature that a guarantee of the emergence of a desired formation cannot be given (in some cases simply because it is not the goal of the work). We have addressed this problem by assigning a unique `right spot' in  the formation to each robot. Thus, when all robots are in place, the desired formation is established. In [5], [10], [3], global knowledge is  assumed: each robot knows the position of all others. In our approach, robots only use local sensing and do not share a common coordinate system. [2], [13] represent robots as points and show simulated experiments with discrete time steps of synchronous robot movements. Each point reacts to all points within some distance of it. In our algorithm, each robot references itself locally to one neighboring robot and keeps a certain bearing and distance to, as in [1], [6], [7], but in contrast to this work, we have demonstrated our algorithm through both simulation and real-world experiments, and with different numbers of robots doing various formations. Bearing this spectrum of movement coordination strategies in mind, we have in our approach sought simplicity yet reliability through local sensing with minimal communication.

III. Our Algorithm
Our key idea is simple: every robot in the group positions itself relative to a designated neighbor robot, its friend. The friend references itself to another friend, and so on. Thus, each robot needs to be able to determine the distance and angle to its friend. The friend-sensor is assumed to be pointing forward with a +-90-degree field of view, Each robot has a unique ID, detectable by other robots through the friend-sensor.  As a result, each robot knows how many robots (N), and which ones, are participating in the formation. The robots are always organized in a chain of friendships by the order of their IDs. One robot is the conductor, deciding the formation and its heading, and thus not following any friend.
